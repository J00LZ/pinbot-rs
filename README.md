# pinbot-rs
> A simple bot that pins messages in Discord

When pinbot is added to your server and given the correct permission, Manage messages, it'll pin any message that has 5 ðŸ“Œ reactions. 

There's no configuration, since that was not really needed for the servers in which I use it. 

If a message's ðŸ“Œ reaction count drops below 3 it'll remove the pin from the message.
